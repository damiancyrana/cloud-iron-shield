## Introduction

Welcome to the **Cloud Iron Shield** project! Cloud Iron Shield is an innovative security management solution that aims to provide robust and impenetrable protection for cloud environments. Leveraging the strength of an Iron Shield, this project focuses on automatically monitoring, reporting, and remedying security configurations in cloud ecosystems like Azure and GCP.

Inspired by the concept of enveloping the Earth in an armor shield, as depicted by Tony Stark in the Marvel Universe, Cloud Iron Shield aims to wrap your cloud infrastructure in a layer of unyielding security.
